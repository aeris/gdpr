Hi,

My personal data, including my email address, are protected under data protection law. The Data protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to the processing of my email address and any other information related to me.

As article 3 provides, the whole GDPR law applies to you because I am an EU citizen, even if your company is based outside of the EU.

As a data controller you are thus subjected to various obligations including notably transparency and information.
Indeed as article 15 states, I have the right to ask you to provide me with all the personal data you have about me, the purpose of the processing, why and how you collect them, if you share my data with other people or countries, etc.

Also, I would like to know under which condition do you process my data (article 6 of the GDPR). If your processing is based on my consent, please send me the information demonstrating that I have consented under the conditions of article 7.

Under article 12 (3), you have one month to fulfill this request. After said period, I will refer the case to the competent supervisory authority.

As per Article 17, I also want all my personal data to be destroyed from your databases or other storage (including backups). **But only after you provide me with the information requested above.**

As per Article 19, I would be grateful if you would ask **any company** to whom you might have transferred my data, to do so as well, and provide me with proof of said destructions.
