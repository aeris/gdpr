Hi,

My personal data, including notably my email address, are protected under European Data Protection law and particularly by GDPR.

As an EU citizen all the data you are processing about me is covered by GDPR. Indeed, as article 3 provides, the whole GDPR law applies to you because you are processing personal data in the Union, even if your company is based outside of the EU.

As you probbaly know, GDPR provides me with various rights. Thus, I am asking you to provide me all the relevant information listed in article 15 and particularly : personal data you have about me, why and how you collect them, the purpose of the processing, if you share my data with other people or countries, etc.

You may also know that you have to inform me of the basis under which you are processing my personal data. If your processing is based on consent, I want you to prove me that I have given the consent specified under article 7 for my data to be collected and processed by you.

As Article 12 provides, you should answer my request without undue delay and in any event within one month 
of its receipt. If you don't comply with this delay, I'll file a complaint to the competent data protection authority.

As per Article 17, I also want all my personal data to be destroyed from your databases or other storage (including backups). **But only after you provide me with the information requested above.**

As per Article 19, I would be grateful if you would ask **any company** to whom you might have transferred my data, to do so as well, and provide me with proof of said destructions.
