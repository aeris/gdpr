Hi,

My personal data, like my email address, are protected under GDPR law since may 2016.

As Article 3 says, the whole GDPR law applies to you because I am an EU citizen, even if your company is based outside of the EU.

As Article 15 says, I have the right to ask you to provide me with all the personal data you have about me, the purpose of the processing, why and how you collect them, if you share my data with other people or countries, etc.

As Article 7 says, I want you to prove me I have given my consent for my data to be collected and processed.

As Article 12 says, you have 1 month to fulfill my request, after which I will open a case to the EU regulator.

I also want all my personal data to be destroyed from your databases or other storage (including backups). **But only after you provide me with the information requested above.**

Regards,
